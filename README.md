# room-booking-bot

personal project for personal convenience

ryerson username (e.g. vivek.george)

currently finds a list of available study rooms based on my  preferred criteria and outputs a list of their available booking times

TODO: 

* enforce resource specification (e.g. whiteboard walls), current room selection seems to ignore the resource choices except for the 8 seats

* select a room
